# How to contribute

## Github workflow

- Explain how to get a local copy of the project - most likely create your own fork of the repo to make changes
- Git workflow - detail process for pull requests, branch names etc.

Example:
> Test

## Testing

- Explain whether tests are necessary (most likely yes, except for very small changes e.g. fixing typos)
- Explain how to run the tests
- For libraries, always compulsory for new features
- For large projects, up to discretion of project owner
- Explain whether or not there are automated tests when pull requests are submitted

## Code reviews

- Explain review process including who reviews it and how the request gets accepted (passes automated tests and passes review by project owner)
- If automated tests running (as above), mention that they need to pass

## How to report a bug

- For security issues, do not submit an issue - email instead (provide email address)
- For other bugs, most likely submit an issue on repo
- Explain any other bug reporting systems (filing bug reports etc.)

## Conventions (optional)

If you have specific conventions for the following, mention them here. Optional because these things are likely to be covered by project READMEs or style guides for specific languages.
- Code style
- Commit message conventions
- Labelling conventions for issues
