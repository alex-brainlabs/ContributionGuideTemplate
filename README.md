# Contribution Guide Template

Provides a template and tips for writing contribution guides for Brainlabs tech. Note that this guide only talks about the mechanics of actually contributing rather than project details like structure or deployment (these will be explained in READMEs and other documentation for individual projects).

NB: This is designed to be used for internal libraries and large projects. For open-source projects, there are many more things that need to be mentioned (behaviour rules, legality etc.) - see [this guide](https://github.com/nayafia/contributing-template/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-template.md) for details.
