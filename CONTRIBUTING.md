For all:
- Walkthrough of how to submit a contribution
- Say whether tests are required (yes) and how to run current tests
- If different process for small or obvious fixes (e.g. typos), explain
- How to report a bug
- How to suggest a feature
- Code review process (who reviews, how it is accepted (CI?))
- Github workflow (pull requests, branch names)

For libraries:
- Tests compulsory

For large projects:
- May want to use a develop branch, with reviewed code pulled into this branch then regular (weekly?) releases into master

For open-source:
- Thanks for contributing
- Ground rules (behaviour etc.)
- Let people know where they can be most helpful
- Legal stuff
- Security
